# Information Exposure From Consumer IoT Devices

This site contains analysis code accompanying the paper "Information Exposure From Consumer IoT Devices: A Multidimensional, Network-Informed Measurement Approach", in proceedings of the ACM Internet Measurement Conference 2019 (IMC 2019), October 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands. 

The official paper page can be found at https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu/imc19/. The page contains instructions for requesting access to the full dataset.

The testbed code and documentation can be found at https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu/tools/. Currently it is deployed at both Northeastern University and Imperial College London.

- `moniotr/`    # Code to automate experiments  
- `destinations/`   # Code for Section 4. Destination Analysis   
- `encryption/` # Code for Section 5. Encryption Analysis   
- `model/`  # Code for Section 6. Content Analysis   

## Datasets
We release the traffic (packet headers) from 34,586 controlled experiments and 112 hours of idle IoT traffic.

The naming convention for the data is `{country}{-vpn}/{device_name}/{activity_name}/{datetime}.{length}.pcap`. For example, `us/amcrest-cam-wired/power/2019-04-10_21:32:18.256s.pcap` is the traffic collected from device `amcrest-cam-wired` when `power` on at the time of 2019-04-10_21:32:18, which lasts `256` seconds in the `us` lab without VPN.

To obtain access to the dataset please follow the instructions on the paper webpage at https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu/imc19. We require that you agree to the terms of our data sharing agreement. 
This is out of an abundance of caution to protect any private or security-sensitive information that we were unable to remove from the traces.
