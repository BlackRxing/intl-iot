Dependencies: pip3 install -r requirements.txt   
We need python3 to run the scripts.

Download [Google Drive > iot-model.tgz](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lMqZ5qx6ATqIIiLOdTYcSm6RliK1F7vA) (size = ~127MB) before running the Juypter Notebook.

[model_sample.ipynb](model_sample.ipynb) walks you through steps that trains a model from traffic of experiments and uses the model to classify (predict) a new traffic observed.

`model.sh` is an equivalent to the Jupyter Notebook, which can be run directly in the terminal. To ananalyze the example data provided, run the following command:

```
./model.sh list_exp.txt
```
